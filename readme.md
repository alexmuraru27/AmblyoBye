In order co convert the movies 
	-> use HandBrake-1.9.0-x86_64-Win_GUI.exe
	-> convert to MP4 H.254 30 fps AAC audio (Unity supports different video formats, but this worked the best for me)
	-> I used Fast 1080p 30 preset, but you can also use quality ones
	
Open the application once, so it can create the directory structure
Then add the mp4 movies in Quest3-> Android -> data -> com.bober101.AmblyoBye/Movies
Relaunch the application and in the DichopticMovie category you should see your movie in the dropdown list
